                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the project page for our Fall Detection System. This system is designed to automatically detect falls using computer vision techniques and Python programming. Falls are a significant health risk, especially for elderly individuals, and early detection can prevent severe injuries and improve quality of life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Our fall detection system leverages advanced computer vision algorithms to monitor and analyze video footage. The core of the system involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Utilizing image processing techniques to analyze video frames and identify potential falls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Training a machine learning model to recognize fall events based on labeled data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Detection:</strong> Implementing real-time processing to detect falls as they occur and alert caregivers or emergency services.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Utility of Fall Detection</h2>
                <p>The utility of a fall detection system extends beyond mere accident prevention. Here are some key benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Immediate Response:</strong> Automated detection ensures that falls are identified and addressed immediately, reducing response times and improving outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Provides reassurance to both individuals and their families or caregivers, knowing that falls will be detected promptly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare Cost Reduction:</strong> By preventing severe injuries through early detection, the system can help reduce healthcare costs associated with fall-related treatments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Collects data on falls that can be used for further research and improvement of safety protocols.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>The fall detection system follows these key steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Video Input:</strong> Captures video footage using a camera placed in the monitored area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frame Analysis:</strong> Processes each video frame to detect changes in the scene that may indicate a fall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fall Detection:</strong> Applies machine learning models to classify detected changes as falls or non-falls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alert System:</strong> Sends alerts to caregivers or emergency services when a fall is detected.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
                <p>Future enhancements to the fall detection system may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Accuracy:</strong> Improving the accuracy of fall detection through more sophisticated algorithms and additional training data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration with Wearables:</strong> Combining the system with wearable devices to provide an additional layer of detection and monitoring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Broader Applications:</strong> Adapting the system for different environments, such as hospitals or nursing homes, to improve safety across various settings.</li>
                </ul>
